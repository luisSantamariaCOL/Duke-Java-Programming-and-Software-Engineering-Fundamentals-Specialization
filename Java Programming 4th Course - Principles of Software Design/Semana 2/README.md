# Module Learning Outcomes / Resources

*Earthquakes: Sorting Algorithms* Module  

In this module, you will continue using real earthquake data to explore several sorting algorithms. You will learn how to implement a selection sort and a bubble sort, then be introduced to a Java method Collections.sort, which sorts with much greater efficiency. By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* implement several sorting algorithms from scratch,
* use efficient pre-existing sorting classes,
* modify a class's compareTo method to choose the criteria by which objects of that type are ordered, and
* write classes that implement the Comparator interface to create interchangeable sorting criteria.
