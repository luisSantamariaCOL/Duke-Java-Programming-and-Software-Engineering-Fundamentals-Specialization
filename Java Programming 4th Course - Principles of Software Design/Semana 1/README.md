---------------------------------------------
*Earthquakes: Programming and Interfaces* Module  

In this module, we will introduce a data set containing details about earthquakes around the world. You will learn  
how to pull this data into a program, search through the data, and filter the data based on desired criteria. By the  
end of this module, you will be able to:  

* write programs that include multiple classes and ArrayLists of class types,
* find the maximum value in an ArrayList,
* use a Filter interface to search through data,
* implement interfaces with method signatures, and
* combine several filters together.
