# Object Oriented Programming

* Java is an OOP  
What does that mean?  

* One of the important characteristics of objects is that they encapsulate **code** and **data**  

### Object = Code + Data  
Code -> Methods
Data -> Fields

An object can be Strings, CSV Records, Image resources, etc...  

### Class = Type, Object = Instance  

* Classes define a types:  
  * Define what is in objects of that type  
* Objects are instances of class  
  * Can make many (using: *new*)
